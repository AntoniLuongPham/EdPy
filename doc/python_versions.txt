Python versions - 16/May/2017

EdPy.py was developed using python 2.7 and used code borrowed from EdWare which was also python 2 based.
But Python 3 is the way to go -- so "from __future__ import xxxx" was used to prepare for that day.

Converting from python 2 to python 3 is one thing, but a bigger issue is that python generates the first
stage in the parsing process. It uses ast.parse (see lib/parser.py NormalPythonParse) to convert the
source into an Abstract Syntax Tree. That tree is then converted to an internal representation (IR)
which is independent of the python version. But the converter (see lib/parser.py class Converter)
needs to know what the python generated AST will look like.

The python AST is very stable, so small python version changes should not affect the functioning of
EdPy.py. BUT a change could affect things, so we settled on python 2.7 (and 2.7.10 specifically)
for the website and for the majority of testing.

Still, python 3 has been around for a long time (a decade?) so this project would like to go in that
direction. Along came Aivar Annamaa, who has contributed changes to allow the code to run under both
2.7 and 3.6.

So the situation is now:
2.7 -- python version used on the website and it has the most testing
3.6 -- new changes which Aivar has done some testing on -- i.e. he reports that clap_controlled_driving
       works fine using either 2.7 or 3.6

Final notes -- Use python 2.7 if stability is extremely important to you, but the future is python 3
so you may want to go in that direction. Thanks Aivar for your work (check out thonny.org)!
